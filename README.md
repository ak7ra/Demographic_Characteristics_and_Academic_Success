# Demographic Characteristics and Academic Success

This is the final project for the graduate level course Bayesian Machine Learning (DS6040) taught at the University of Virginia. 

Academic success is often seen as linked to future success and opportunities. However, it is not necessarily the case that a child’s academic success (measured by assigned grades) solely depends on their motivation and effort. There are many environmental and developmental factors that contribute to this which we aim to examine through our project. Our goals for this project are to 1) Describe the uncertainty surrounding academic success for secondary students given their demographic indicators and 2) Predict the final grade for each student. The data are from Kaggle and consist of 33 predictor variables. We propose to use Bayesian models to determine a student’s level of success in class.

The project uses several Bayesian regression models, specifically two simple Bayesian linear regression models and a Bayesian Additional Regression Trees (BART) model, to explore the uncertainty surrounding a student's academic success given their demographic characteristics. 

The code written in `Bayesian_Models.ipynb` uses the Python programming language and Python packages such as pymc3.
